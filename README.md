In python, and given standard algebraic notation of a chess board (see below), write code that will:

Accept two parameters:
1.	Type of chess piece (Queen, Rook, Knight)
2.	Current position on a chess board (for example: d2)

Return:
	A list of all the potential board positions the given piece could advance to, with one move, from the given position, with the assumption there are no other pieces on the board.

# Rules:
- You do not have to implement the solution for every piece type, but the solution must implement at least the following: Queen, Rook and Knight.
- You may not use any external/non-core libraries: use only primitives and built-ins.
- Please provide test coverage for your work.

# Example:
`$ chessercise.py --piece KNIGHT --position d2`

The response should be:  `â€œb1, f1, b3, f3,c4, e4"`
